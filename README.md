# Capacities

## TODO
1. ~~Add inequality constraints.~~
2. ~~Implement wrapper func that applies a set func to compute marginals in equality constraint.~~
3. ~~Implement mobius transform.~~
4. Convex and supermodular distortion.

## Known Bugs
1. If |X| != |Y|, then we numerically cannot find a solution.
2. If |X| != |Y|, then the indexing when constructing the equality constraints is out of bounds.
